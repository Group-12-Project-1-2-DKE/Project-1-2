# Project-1-2
Repository for Project 1-2 of DKE

Work in progress. File does not run as one complete simulation.

Program can run in seperate parts.

To launch the UI with working buttons and filereaders, do the following:
1. Open the files, and search for the file SelectScreen.java (golf\core\src\ui\selectscreen.java)
2. Run the main method in the SelectScreen.java file.

// Mode 1 works fine including the filereader, Mode 2 shows a good working UI, but does not work due to small errors.

To run the LibGDX, do the following.
1. Open the files, and search for the file DesktopLauncher.java (golf\desktop\src\com\mygdx\game\desktop\DesktopLauncher.java)
2. Execute the file.
